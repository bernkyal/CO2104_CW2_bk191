# CO2104_CW2_bk191, My CO2104 Course Work Project 

https://bernkyal.github.io/CO2104_CW2_bk191/

Above is the link to the page for this application.
The page may take some time to load, keep refreshing or stay on the page if it doesn't load immediately.
This is the uploaded version of the UI project to be used as fallback in case the application doesn't run on your local device.
Although I don't expect you to run into issues, as I've tested and built this application myself before uploading.
It's reassuring to know there will be a fallback incase you aren't able to see it or the right modules aren't pre-installed. For instance npm.

Looking forward to hearing more about this project
